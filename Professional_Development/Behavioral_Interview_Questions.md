# <r>Interview Questions</r>


## <o>What is your greatest strength?</o>

## <o>Tell me about a time you worked effectively under pressure</o>

* While I was studying in my program to learn software development we were often given projects with a short time frame to complete them. Often we would be given the task of creating an application within 5 days while also continuing to attend class everyday. As well, we were often required to self teach and successfully implement new technologies into our projects.  
* I found that I worked best when I broke the project down into smaller pieces and focused on one piece at a time. This would mean working through a project iteratively. I would start with the basic functionality and then add features as I went along.
* I would also make sure to take breaks often, usually with the pomodoro method, to clear my head and come back to the project with a fresh perspective.
* Often these project were collaborative so I found it helpful to delegate certain tasks to other members of the group. For example, our first project in React  This allowed us to work more efficiently and get more done in a shorter amount of time.

## <o>How do you handle challenges?</o>

* When given something that is challenging, no matter what it is, I like take a second to step back and breathe
* Depending on the task I will rework the challenge through my head and work to see or explain it in a different way. This helps to give insight to solutions I may not have seen before
* I will break the challenge down into smaller pieces and work through each piece one at a time. Often while working on the first part or step I will see the solution to the next part
* I also like to talk through the challenge with someone else. If I am unable to make progress on a challenge I will reach out to a friend or colleague to see if they can offer insight. Often the process of explaining the challenge to someone else will help me to see the solution
* I like to take breaks when working on something challenging to give my mind rest. Stopping to take a walk or do something else for a bit will help me to come back to the challenge with a fresh perspective

## <o>Have you ever made a mistake? How did you handle it?</o>
* I have made many mistakes in my life. I think it is important to make mistakes and learn from them.
* My perspective is that its okay to make mistakes but the important thing is to be honest, communicate your mistake to others, work to fix it and learn from the experience so you don't make the same mistake again.
* One mistake I made was when I was working on a project in my program. I was creating an application that would allow users to search for a movie from an API. We were supposed to test the application and account for all possible error handling to prevent bugs. When my instructor was testing my application he was able to break it by typing in a junk subdirectory in the url. I had not accounted for this in my code and it caused the application to break. I was able to fix the issue by adding a catch all route to my code. This would redirect the user to the home page if they typed in a junk subdirectory. I learned from this experience to always test my code thoroughly and account for all possible scenarios.

## <o>What is your greatest weakness?</o>
* I have a tendency to be work too much. Even though I give myself breaks often when I am programming I get so focused on the task that it is hard for me to stop working on that task until it is finished. This can mean sometimes skipping lunch because I am so determined 
* I have found that breaking down even small tasks into little steps helps me set a point where I can stop working without overdoing it. 

## <o> Give an example of a time you worked on a team</o>
* For my capstone project in my program we were given the task of creating a full-stack application in 2 weeks. As part of the front-end program we were paired with students from the back-end program to work on the project together.
* We started by coming up with an idea for an application and the possible features we would like to add
* Then we went through and chose which features we thought we would be able to add successfully in the time frame we had and which features we would like to add if we had the time
* We then wireframed the basic user flow and styling for the application
* Each day we would meet for stand ups where we would talk about what we had accomplished the day before and what we wanted to accomplish for the day. Often bringing up any blockers we had any working through them as a group
* Throughout the day we communicated through slack. If the front-end needed something from the back-end we would reach out to them and let them know and vice versa
* We also set up a project board on github to keep track of what we had accomplished and what we still needed to do. Noting any issues or bugs we came across
