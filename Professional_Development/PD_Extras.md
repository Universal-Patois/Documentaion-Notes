write out your transition story- talk about positive change you were looking to  make as you went step to step. fishing was exciting because...

I orginally picked psychology because I was interested in understanding and relating to people more.
 When I graduated I realized I wasnt going to be able to find a job unless I had a masters degree and I wasnt sure if I wanted more student loans. I eventually found the fishing industry from a roommate. I really enjoyed the challenge of it and how it allowed me to meet people from all over the world. But, after awhile I wanted a job that was more mentally stimulating. One that I could continue to learn new things and apply them to something I could help create and be a part of. When I was introduced to programming I found I really enjoyed the problem solving part aspect and breadth of knowledge within the field.

your story from perspective of co workers

do a retro after interview- maybe implement feedback- when were people most responsive/positive.

keep finding people to do mock interviews with
practice technical questions out loud
meet weekly with someone

## <o>Advice for applying to a position</o>

Applying for jobs can be time consuming!

A lot of jobs have 200+ applicants!

Here’s how to stand out..

Find the hiring manager or recruiter (sometimes it’s listed on the posting) and SEND a personalized message!

You have nothing to lose and not everyone does this.

Introduce yourself, mention you applied to the job and why you would be a great fit. PRO tip- add an extra fact about the company or role to show you did your research.

Since you can’t message those who you aren’t connected to, send a connection request and add a note.

Don’t be shy! Sending a message shows that I’m personable and willing to go above and beyond.

I didn’t do this for all the jobs I applied for and I wish I started doing this earlier!
