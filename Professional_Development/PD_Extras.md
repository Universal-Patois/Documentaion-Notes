# Extra Things to Remember for PD

## When offered a position/ An interviewer seems interested

* "To make the onboarding process easier for us what can I do over the weekend?"

[] Create app in tech stack of job
[] Show project of it

* Ask: "Is there anything that would cause you to hesitate to recommend me to the next round?"

### Behavioral Prep

* Write down accomplishments

* Presentation- what did it feel like to be successful?
* Difficult code problem- tie in past experience
* Stressful situation

* Make responses conversational

* Bring problem solving into elevator pitch. Why did you choose programming?- Add that it was for the problem solving aspect
* Example of negative critical feedback and how you took that feedback(can be implicit)

* Quality Assurance example- Pull requests, code reviews, paired programming circleCI
* TDD- benefits- it isolates issues, saves time/money testing compared to saving testing until the end

### Tech Prep

Prompt attention: Ask-

* "Does this make sense?"
* "How am I doing?"
* "On the right track?"
* "Would you like more detail?"
* "Would you like me to continue?"
* ASK CLARIFYING QUESTIONS
* Quality assurance can be: a Pull request, code review, paired programming or circleCI
* TDD benefits- isolates issues, can save time/money by not leaving it for the end of the application

### Takeaways

* Bring problem solving to elevator pitch- I wanted to change from my previous career for more flexibilty also love puzzles and problem solving

write out your transition story- talk about positive change you were looking to  make as you went step to step. fishing was exciting because...

I orginally picked psychology because I was interested in understanding and relating to people more. When I graduated I realized I wasnt going to be able to find a job unless I had a masters degree and I wasnt sure if I wanted more student loans. I eventually found the fishing industry from a roommate. I really enjoyed the challenge of it and how it allowed me to meet people from all over the world. But, after awhile I wanted a job that was more mentally stimulating. One that I could continue to learn new things and apply them to something I could help create and be a part of. When I was introduced to programming I found I really enjoyed the problem solving part aspect and breadth of knowledge within the field.

your story from perspective of co workers

do a retro after interview- maybe implement feedback- when were people most responsive/positive.

keep finding people to do mock interviews with
practice technical questions out loud
meet weekly with someone



* project before two week cohort?
* what does that look like?

* what is exactly is the two week cohort? 
* what do we do?
* what is the criteria the hiring managers usually use to decide whether they want to offer an internship?
* what happens if we are not selected after the two weeks?
* is the two weeks paid?

* in person everyday for two weeks?
* then hybrid 60%/40% remote/in person for the internship?
* will they want to continue hybrid after the internship?
* will they ever allow remote work?

* what is the compensation for the internship?
* relocation assistance?
* what is the probability of getting offered a salary after the internship?
* how do they determine that?
* what happens if they don't offer a long term position?

* what would a recommendation for an east coast program look like?
* would there be a similar start date?
* would there be a similar two week cohort?
