## <o>Example of building an application from provided specifications</o>
* In my program half of the time we were given projects to complete with specific requirements 
* They would be instructions on the specific type of application and what features it should have
* It would also include a list of technologies we were required to use and had iterations of the project we were supposed to follow

## <o>Time when you developed unit tests and code coverage</o>
* In my current role my job was to create a testing plan for our application and execute it. I created a test plan that included unit tests for our back-end code and web scrapping files as well as end-to-end testing for our front-end. I used Jest for the unit tests and Cypress for the end-to-end tests.
* I was able to get 95% code coverage for the application
* We are still working on some of the testing right now. One of the things we are trying to do is set up a test database to run our tests on. This would allow us to test our database queries without affecting the production database. We are also working on setting up a CI/CD pipeline to run our tests automatically when we push to github.

## <o>Have you done code reviews?</o>
* This is something that I have implemented in my current role. 
* We have a pull request template that I created to make sure all of the necessary information is included in the pull request
* This also includes a checklist that we use to make sure we have tested the code and that it meets our standards
* For each pull request the developer will assign a reviewer before the PR is able to be merged.
* This reviewer is often me and I make sure to go through to code to ensure it is clean and readable and contains any comments for parts that may be confusing


## <o>How do you write/keep track of your documentation?</o>
* I start with using version control like git and github to keep track of my code and changes
* While developing I will make atomic commits that are small and focused on one specific change
* If there are parts of the code I think are confusing I will add comments to explain what is happening
* Within the commit message I will include a brief description of the change
* With that in mind I like to keep the branch Im working on focused to one specific feature or task to avoid scope creep
* This way when a PR is made it is easy to look through the commits to see what changes were made
* I also like to use a project board to keep track of my tasks and what I have completed
* When working on a project I will create a README file that includes 
    * A description of the application
    * A list of technologies used
    * Instructions on how to set up and use the application locally
    * A deployed link to the application once the application is finished
    * A link to the deployed application once finished
    * Screenshots of the application
    * Database schemas


## <o>How do you keep track of your tasks?</o>
* I use a project board on github separated by columns for either front-end, back-end, UX/UI, Web Scraping, Bugs, and Done
* I will create issues for each task I need to complete and assign them to myself or another developer
* For each stage we will have a different project board with the tasks we need to complete for that stage

## <o>Have you provided support for an application you developed?</o>
* In my current role I am the main developer for our application
* When a new developer is brought on I have taken the responsibility of onboarding them and getting them up to speed on the application
* As well if any of the other developers have questions about the application or they have any issues I am the one they come to for help

## <o>Why do you want to leave your current job?</o>
* My goal has been to work in the non-profit sector. Right now my company creates software and websites for people and retailers in various industries. 
* I wanted to work for a company that was more aligned with my values and goals. I am looking for a company that is more focused on helping people and making a difference in the world
* Its a startup and I am looking for a more stable environment with better structure
