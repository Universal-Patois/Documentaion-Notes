# Netlify

## Why do I feel technology should be accessible to everyone?

* I believe that technology should be accessible to everyone because it is a tool that can be used to help people in many ways.
* It has helped me in many ways like organization, communication, and productivity.
* It has helped me connect with others in ways that I would not have been able to otherwise.

* Providing customers support would achieve this goal by:
  * helping them to understand how to use the product
  * empowering them to use the product on their own and to its full potential
  * Once they understand how to use the product, they can use it to help themselves and others.


## My passion for helping others

* I have always been passionate about helping others.
* I was a psychology major in college and I have always been interested in how people think and how they can be helped.

Examples of how I have helped others in resolving a technical issue:

* As mentor to students in the front end program that were in a lower module
  * Help them when learning iterator methods
    * Like how with ```map()```  you could not only use it to map over and array to manipulate it but also use it to return an object with key value pairs that you defined
  * Having trouble with their project trying to fetch data from an API and display it
    * Helped them work through the problem in steps
      * What error are you getting?
      * How is the data being returned from the API?
      * How can you access the data you want?

        * It felt really good to help them work through the problem and see them get excited when they figured it out.
        * Now that I had helped them with the process of working through the problem, they were able to do it on their own

## What I like about Netlifys support values

* It focused on making the information to help the customer easier to understand and more accessible.
  * I enjoy making documentation that is layed out neatly and is easily accessible.
* Showcasing their success with things like site of the week
* The main focus seemed to be on having empathy for the customer and their experience with the product.
  * By understanding their experience with the product, you can better help them to understand how to use it and how to get the most out of it.
  * By being empathic and understanding it not only helps them but it helps the company by retaining the customer and having them be a brand ambassador.
  * By lifting them up we are lifting up the company.

## About me

Ive always been an empathic person. It feels good to help someone
I got into psychology because I wanted to help others. But I didnt pursue it because I didnt want to go to grad school and take on more debt.

I then traveled a lot and found the fishing industry. It was a unique experience that was challenging and enjoyable at times.

But I didnt just want a job that made me money. I wanted one that I could continue to learn new things and apply them to something I could help create and be a part of.

I discovered coding and really enjoyed the problem solving aspect of it. And that there is such a depth of information to learn for almost every topic.
But also I realized that programming is really just a way to help others with technology.
And that by working with products that are used by others,I can help make a difference in their lives and reach more people than I ever could with psychology

## what are you looking for in the future

* I want to continue to deepen my skills as a front end developer while also learning more about the back end and incorporating that knowledge.
* I eventually want to work in a full stack role. I really enjoy learning how both the front and back end technologies work together.
  * I enjoy writing quality code that is thoroughly tested and documented, is accessible, meets seo, and is optimized for performance.
* My goal for even further down the line is to work as a product manager
  * I want to be able to design a product that is optimized based on the clients needs
  * Understand how to write scalable code that is easy to maintain and update, that meets time and space complexity requirements
