# <r>LinkedIn Notes</r>

* There is a recruiter license for LinkedIn
* InMail credits- dont click on the link if it is not matched at all

## <o>What do Recruiters do?</o>

* Find candidates or jobs
* Help negotiate salary/ job offer
* Send CV to employer

* Advise on market trends

## <o>Process</o>

* Find the vibe of the team
    * If they're casual or open, find if people are a good fit for that environment


#### When recruiters reach out to you with a job that doesnt match your experience
* Ask them why they reached out to you. Why they think you're a good fit
