# <r>Interview Questions</r>

## <o>Explain your full-stack collaboration</o>

* We came up with an idea for an application and the possible features we would like
* We wireframed the basic user flow and styling for the application
* Our new technology was GraphQL. So we spent time learning that
* We established our working relationship where we shared how each of us worked best, the times we liked to work, and availability
* We discussed the information we wanted presented to the user from google maps API
* We then picked features we wanted for a MVP
* We also had features we wanted to add if we had the time
* Back-end set up endpoints for us to use for querying the information
* We me every morning for stand ups where each of us talked about what we wanted to accomplish for the day and what we had done the day before
* Once the MVP was met we discussed what else we wanted to add given the time we had left
* We all communicated through slack so when the front-end needed something we would reach out to the back-end to let them know
* It was a very enjoyable and collaborative experience

* I can keep my documentation right in my IDE to easily access when needed
* Helps to reinforce what I'm learning
