* We discussed the information we wanted presented to the user from google maps API
* We then picked features we wanted for a MVP
* We also had features we wanted to add if we had the time
* Back-end set up endpoints for us to use for querying the information
* We me every morning for stand ups where each of us talked about what we wanted to accomplish for the day and what we had done the day before
* Once the MVP was met we discussed what else we wanted to add given the time we had left
