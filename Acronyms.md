# <r>Acronyms in development</r>

## <o>RESTful</o>

<i>**Representational State Transfer**</i>

  - <h>RESTful</h> is an adjective describing a style of software architecture for distributed hypermedia systems such as the World Wide Web. RESTful systems are characterized by how they are stateless and separate the concerns of client and server. RESTful systems typically use HTTP for data transfer, and transfer the state of the system using URIs and hypermedia.

## <o>REST</o>

  - <h>REST</h> is an architectural style for distributed hypermedia systems such as the World Wide Web. REST is a software architectural style that defines a set of constraints to be used for creating Web services. Web services that conform to the REST architectural style, called RESTful Web services, provide interoperability between computer systems on the Internet. RESTful Web services allow the requesting systems to access and manipulate textual representations of Web resources by using a uniform and predefined set of stateless operations.

## <o>SOAP</o>
<i>**Simple Object Access Protocol**</i>

  - <h>SOAP</h> is a messaging protocol specification for exchanging structured information in the implementation of web services in computer networks. Its purpose is to provide extensibility, neutrality, verbosity and independence. It uses XML Information Set for its message format, and relies on application layer protocols, most often Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) or Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP), for message negotiation and transmission.
  
## <o>API</o>

<i>**Application Programming Interface**</i>

  - An application programming interface (API) is a set of subroutine definitions, protocols, and tools for building software applications. An API specifies how software components should interact. It can also be understood as a set of clearly defined methods of communication among various components. A good API makes it easier to develop a computer program by providing all the building blocks, which are then put together by the programmer. An API may be for a web-based system, operating system, database system, computer hardware, or software library.

## <o>CRUD</o>

<i>**Create, Read, Update, Delete**</i>

  - These are the four basic functions of persistent storage. Alternate words are sometimes used when defining the four basic functions of CRUD, such as retrieve instead of read, modify instead of update, or destroy instead of delete. CRUD is also sometimes used to describe user interface conventions that facilitate viewing, searching, and changing information. A user interface that facilitates these four functions is said to implement CRUD functionality.

## <o>HTTP</o>

<i>**Hypertext Transfer Protocol**</i>

  - <h>*HTTP*</h> is an application protocol for distributed, collaborative, hypermedia information systems. HTTP is the foundation of data communication for the World Wide Web, where hypertext documents include hyperlinks to other resources that the user can easily access, for example by a mouse click or by tapping the screen in a web browser. HTTP is the protocol to exchange or transfer hypertext. 

  * The World Wide Web is built on top of HTTP. HTTP follows a classical client-server model, with a client opening a connection to make a request, then waiting until it receives a response. HTTP is a stateless protocol, meaning that the server does not keep any data (state) between two requests. Although often based on a TCP/IP layer, it can be used on any reliable transport layer. HTTP is an application layer protocol that relies on other lower-level protocols, such as TCP/IP, to establish a reliable connection and to ensure the data integrity.

## <o>URI</o>

<i>**Uniform Resource Identifier**</i>

  -  <h>*Uniform Resource Identifier (URI)*</h> is a string of characters that unambiguously identifies a particular resource. URIs are used to identify resources in many different contexts, including web pages, files, and abstract or physical resources. A URI is a compact sequence of characters that identifies an abstract or physical resource. A URI can be further classified as a locator, a name, or both. The term "Uniform Resource Identifier" (URI) is often used as a synonym for a URL or a URN.

## <o>URL</o>

<i>**Uniform Resource Locator**</i>

- A <h>*Uniform Resource Locator (URL)*</h>, colloquially termed a web address, is a reference to a web resource that specifies its location on a computer network and a mechanism for retrieving it. A URL is a specific type of Uniform Resource Identifier (URI), although many people use the two terms interchangeably. A URL implies the means to access an indicated resource, which is not true of every URI. URLs occur most commonly to reference web pages (http), but are also used for file transfer (ftp), email (mailto), database access (JDBC), and many other applications.

## <o>MVC</o>

<i>**Model-View-Controller**</i>

  * The architectural pattern separates an application into three main logical components: 
    * <h>the model</h> - manages business logic and data (database)
    * <h>the view</h> - handles layout and display (HTML/Javascript)
    * <h>the controller</h> - handles user input and interactions. Routes commands to the model and view. (HTML/CSS)

  - Each of these components are built to handle specific development aspects of an application. The MVC design pattern decouples these major components allowing for code reuse and parallel development. The MVC pattern is used to implement user interfaces on computers. It divides a given software application into three interconnected parts. This is done to separate internal representations of information from the ways information is presented to and accepted from the user. 

## NPM

<i>**Node Package Manager**</i>

  * <h>npm</h> is a package manager for the JavaScript programming language. It is the default package manager for the JavaScript runtime environment Node.js. It consists of a command line client, also called npm, and an online database of public and paid-for private packages, called the npm registry. The registry is accessed via the client, and the available packages can be browsed and searched via the npm website. The registry contains over 800,000 packages with over 3 million versions.

## <o>OMD/ORM</o>

<i>**Object Data Model/ Object Relational Model**</i>

## <o>JSON</o>
<i>**JavaScript Object Notation**</i>

  * <h>JSON</h> is an open-standard file format that uses human-readable text to transmit data objects consisting of attribute–value pairs and array data types (or any other serializable value). It is a very common data format used for asynchronous browser–server communication, including as a replacement for XML in some AJAX-style systems. JSON is a language-independent data format. It was derived from JavaScript, but many modern programming languages include code to generate and parse JSON-format data. The official Internet media type for JSON is application/json. JSON filenames use the extension .json. 

## <o>SQL</o>
<i>**Structured Query Language**</i>

  * <h>SQL</h> is a domain-specific language used in programming and designed for managing data held in a relational database management system (RDBMS), or for stream processing in a relational data stream management system (RDSMS). It is particularly useful in handling structured data, i.e. data incorporating relations among entities and variables. SQL offers two main advantages over older read–write APIs such as ISAM or VSAM. Firstly, it introduced the concept of accessing many records with one single command. Secondly, it eliminates the need to specify how to reach a record, e.g. with or without an index.
