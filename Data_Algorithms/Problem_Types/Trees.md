Trees are a data structure that is similar to a linked list, but instead of each node pointing to the next node, each node points to a number of nodes. 
  * A tree is a collection of nodes connected by directed (or undirected) edges. 
  * A tree is a nonlinear data structure, compared to arrays, linked lists, stacks and queues which are linear data structures. 
  * A tree can be empty with no nodes or a tree is a structure consisting of one node called the root and zero or one or more subtrees.
