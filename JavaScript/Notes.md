## Comparison Operators
In JavaScript, the comparison operators above can also be used to compare strings.
In that case, a dictionary (lexicographical) order is applied.
You can find a list of the exact order of all the characters [here][utf-16-list].

```javascript
'Apple' > 'Pear';
// => false

'a' < 'above';
// => true

'a' === 'A';
// => false
```
